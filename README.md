What version of Python do you use?

****[SLAPP3](https://github.com/terna/SLAPP3) uses Python 3****

****[SLAPP2](https://github.com/terna/SLAPP2) uses Python 2****


***Swarm-Like Agent Protocol in Python***

At [SLAPP 3](https://github.com/terna/SLAPP3), you have SLAPP running in Python 3 (in the [SLAPP repository](http://terna.to.it/slapp_dep/) you have a lot related material and a large set of old versions; the [2.0](https://github.com/terna/SLAPP2).x version is the last one related to Python 2).

We have here also a [**Reference Handbook**](https://github.com/terna/SLAPP/blob/v.3.0/SLAPP_Reference_Handbook.pdf) (it is still a draft and has to be improved).

Five chapters of the book of Boero, R., Morini, M., Sonnessa, M., and Terna, P.,  [Agent-based Models of the Economy - From Theories to Applications](http://www.palgrave.com/page/detail/agentbased-models-of-the-economy-/?K=9781137339805), are related to SLAPP.

We have also the [SLAPP online 1](http://slapp-online.net:6789) (quite obsolete) and [SLAPP online 2](https://slapp.hopto.org:6789) running versions, aimed to simplify
the initial knowledge of SLAPP; write to *pietro.terna at unito.it* to obtain an access.

In October 2016 I taught a course on *Agent-Based Simulation* for the [Master in Data Science for Complex Economic Systems, MADAS](http://www.madas.carloalberto.org/) and for the [Vilfredo Pareto Doctorate in Economics](http://www.sde.unito.it/). I have introduced SLAPP both as a tutorial in agent-based programming and a simulation shell, with some comparative references to NetLogo. Look [here](http://terna.to.it/sim/2016/) for the contents and videos of the course; have also a preliminary look to the [_README.txt](http://terna.to.it/sim/2016/_README.txt) file.  
The file 2.mp4 of lesson 4 contains, from minute 41, a short introduction to the use of SLAPP online.
